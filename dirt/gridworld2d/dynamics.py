gridworld2d dynamics:

Rigid objects have a position (x) and orientation (r)
and are acted upon by a translation (dx) and a rotation (dr).

Positions (x) are 2d integers between (0,0) and (h,w).
Translations (dx) are unbounded 2d integers.
Orientations (r) are integers between 0 and 4.
Rotations (dr) are unbounded integers.

Dynamics expressed in global coordinates are computed as:
x1 = (clip or wrap)(x0 + dx)
r1 = (wrap)(r0 + dr)

Dynamics expressed in local coordinates are computed as:
x1 = (clip or wrap)(x0 + r0 * dx)
r1 = (wrap)(r0 + dr)
